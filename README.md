Vagrant Setups
==============

This repo is meant to provide various Vagrant builts with various technology implementations.

Currently meant to support Vagrant 1.2.X

Enjoy!

Currently Working
=================
All the setups should work; however, my laravel setup is one that I constantly test and tweak. I might deprecate the others in favor of just adjusting this one.

There maybe a Ruby one coming up


OS
============

There are a ton of different vagrant boxes available out there and it would not make sense to make a distro for every single one of them. I'll be using Ubuntu Precise 64 for all of my builds.

You're welcome to checkout [Vagrantbox.es](http://vagrantbox.es)
