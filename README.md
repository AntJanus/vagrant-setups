Vagrant Setups
==============

This repo is meant to provide various Vagrant builts with various technology implementations. 

Currently meant to support Vagrant 1.0.7 (my current working version)

Enjoy!

OS
============

There are a ton of different vagrant boxes available out there and it would not make sense to make a distro for every single one of them. I'll be using Ubuntu Precise 64 for all of my builds.

You're welcome to checkout [Vagrantbox.es](http://vagrantbox.es)
